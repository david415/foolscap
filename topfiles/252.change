Foolscap tools no longer accept "tcp:0" as a listening port, nor do they
automatically detect the host's IP addresses in an attempt to build
externally-reachable FURLs. In particular:

* for all tools, if '--port' is provided, it must not be tcp:0
* 'flappserver create' now requires --location, and '--port' defaults to
  tcp:3116
* 'flogtool create-gatherer' requires --location, default port is tcp:3117
* 'flogtool create-incident-gatherer' does too, default is tcp:3118
